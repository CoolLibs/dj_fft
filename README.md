### Details

This repository provides a header-only library to compute fourier transforms in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Its goal is to provide a fast and easy-to-use fast fourier transform algorithm. 

### Usage
For a usage example, see the examples/ directory. 

### Future Extensions
Note that at some point I'll also add a GPU port of this code -- stay tuned ;)

### License

The code from this repository is released in public domain.
